# Image Super-Resolution
Make low resolution images high resolution using ESPCN. An ML Showcase project from Paperspace Gradient.

# Description
<p>ESPCN consists of convolutional layers for feature extraction, followed by sub-pixel convolution for upsampling. We'll use the DIV2K dataset for training.</p><p>For a deeper explanation of the concepts covered in this notebook, check out <a href="https://blog.paperspace.com/image-super-resolution/">Image Super-Resolution: A Comprehensive Review</a> on the blog. </p>
